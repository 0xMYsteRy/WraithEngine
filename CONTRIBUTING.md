## Contributing

When contributing, please make sure to write javadocs and unit tests as needed to cover what you make. It helps us all greatly and improves the quality of newly contributed code. :)

All pull requests are scanned by SonarCloud and BetterCodeHub to aid in keeping code maintainability high. If your pull request drops maintainability by a small amount, the PR might still be merged and refactored later. If there is significant dropping of maintainability, the PR will not be merged right away while those issues are being fixed.

There is no limit to how often you can submit pull requests, so have fun and go all out!

#### What can be contributed?

Most features, tweaks, and bug fixes will be accepted if they follow the direction WraithEngine is being developed on. The guidelines for what can and cannot be developed are not too strict, however, contributions should maintain the overal goals of WraithEngine. For example, new features such as terrain editing tools, new UI elements, better model rendering, rigging support, or API improvements are great features and eagerly accepted. Meanwhile, features such as voxel map editors or character models might be better as a mod for WraithEngine instead.

WraithEngine should be maintained as a general purpose game engine to avoid bloating the repository size with more project-specific features. The general guidelines for what does or doesn't qualify are on a case-by-case basis. If you're not sure, feel free to ask in the issues tab! 

It's also worth noting that any changes which violate the [Comminity Guidelines](https://github.com/TheDudeFromCI/WraithEngine/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) will not be accepted.
