## Contributing
WraithEngine is open-source and community-driven. All contributions are welcome and highly encouraged! If you see an area of the project which is lacking, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. If you want to help but aren't sure where to start:

* Test Coverage

    Extra tests are always awesome! They help prevent potential bugs and improve the stability of areas of the project which might have been overlooked in the past. If you think of some important tests which weren't originally added, feel free to submit them.
    
* Documentation

    Sometimes documentation is poorly worded or doesn't properly explain what's going on. If you think of a better way of explaining something, or just generally tweaking the grammer and formatting, go for it.
* Bug Fixes

    This is a pretty straight forward one. Bugs happen, and they suck, a lot. But if you have some time to squash a few of them, the community would greatly appreciate it!
    
* Features and Enhancements

    These are the realy big ones, for the brave. If you see a crucial feature on the todo list, that's really taking far too long to be implemented, feel free to get the ball rolling. It keeps things moving and ensures that the most important features actually make it into the project.
